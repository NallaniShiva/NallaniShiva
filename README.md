## Hi there 👋


## 👋 About Me

I am a DevOps and Data Analyst with hands-on experience in cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and data analysis. I work with AWS and Linux to support reliable systems and use SQL and Python to analyse data and deliver clear insights for business decision-making.

I have experience creating dashboards and reports using Power BI and Excel, and I enjoy working with data to identify trends, improve performance, and support operational teams. I also have practical exposure to DevOps tools and cloud-based environments used in production systems.

I am continuously developing my technical skills and am actively seeking opportunities in the UK where I can contribute to data-driven and cloud-focused teams while growing professionally.
